Energy Blockchain - An energy trading platform using Blockchain Technology

Abstractâ€”The blockchain is a non tamperable ledger built on
top of distributed network and enables the transactions to be
secure and transparent. This research paper will emphasize on
peer-to-peer energy trading using Blockchain technology and
Smart Contracts. It helps prosumers to sell an extra amount of
energy as well as consume energy according to their demand
without depending on intermediates. Peer-to-peer trading helps
in eradication of brokers. The Ethereum Blockchain helps in
rapid deployment, easy payment settlement, and transactions.
We have proposed Powerloan system - a credit based payment
system. Energy coins will be provided to users based on their
credit value. Stackelberg Game is used to maximize the utility
of a credit bank.
